trained CNN to obtain the training and testing results.
required to understand the whole process of compiling different layers
(Convolutional Layer, Fully-Connected Layer, Pooling Layer, Activation Layer, Loss function) of a
simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the visual classification task. And you need to
compile your own evaluation code to evaluate the trained CNN to obtain the training and testing
results.
